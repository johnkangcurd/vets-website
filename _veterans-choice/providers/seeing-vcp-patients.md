                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>Treating Veteran patients through the Choice Program may require some processes that differ from ones you’re used to. Here we’ll give you an overview of the program and what to expect when treating a Veteran patient. All Veterans using the program, and care to be administered must be pre-approved. If you have questions, you can read our <a href="/veterans-choice/providers/faqs/">Provider FAQs</a> or contact us at 1-866-606-8198.</p>

                        <li>For schedule II prescriptions, either a signed hard-copy along with the Veterans Authorization letter must be mailed by you to the VA pharmacy or given to the Veteran to mail or take in person to the VA pharmacy.</li>
                        <li>If it is an urgent medication is needed, a 14-day supply can be filled at a local pharmacy. If the remaining supply is needed, a separate prescription is to be written and sent to the VA pharmacy to be filled (or given to the Veteran).</li>
