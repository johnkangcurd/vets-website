                    <h3>How you can help our Nation’s Veterans</h3>
                    <p>Tens-of-thousands of VA employees deliver care to nearly six million Veterans through VA's network of 154 Medical Centers; 800 Community-Based Outpatient Clinics; 126 Nursing Homes; and 35 Domiciliary facilities. Yet, despite the reach of this vast network, there are times when VA turns to community providers and asks them to serve too.</p>
                    <p>The Veterans Choice Program was put into place to give Veterans options for access to care in the community when VA can't meet Veteran needs in a timely or convenient manner.</p>
