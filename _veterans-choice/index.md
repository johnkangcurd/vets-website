                    <h3>Helping Veterans get access to care in the community.</h3>
                    <p>The Veterans Choice Program is a new, temporary benefit that allows eligible Veterans to receive health care in their communities. If you are already enrolled in VA health care, you may be able to receive care within your community, instead of waiting for a VA appointment or traveling to a VA facility. Once your eligibility is confirmed, the rest is easy, just follow the steps below.</p>

                                <p>To get started, you’ll need to pick a Choice health care physician, gather some information and give us a call. We will work with you to ensure you are approved for care in your community and to schedule your appointment with an authorized Choice provider. This process could take 7-10 days.

                                <p>This step will walk you through what you need to have your prescriptions filled.
